# My Portfolio
My official portfolio website

##Lessons Learned
My first project built with Sass, I thoroughly enjoyed using partials to organise my code into files aswell as implementing nesting to keep different elements and selectors in one place

It was my first in-depth dive into using Gsap animation and I learnt a lot about scrolltrigger properties and using the `matchMedia()` method to only apply animations at certain screen widths which was a challenging problem to overcome

Lastly, I learnt how to use the navigator objects clipboard property to copy content to the users clipboard

##challenges I faced
My biggest challenge was getting animation to stop working on mobile screen sizes as it was breaking my mobile menu, eventually I managed to overcome this with both the `matchMedia()` and `saveStyles()` methods

Another issue I had was that my mobile menu wouldn't close when navigating from menu to a section of the portfolio, I managed to fix this pretty quick using a simple event listener to remove the mobile menu class when clicking links
